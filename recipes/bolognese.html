        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps" id="for-pasta">
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan until shimmering. Add the onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Scrape the vegetable mixture into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil to the saucepan and heat until just shimmering. Add the beef, veal, and pork and cook over moderately high heat until just barely pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return the vegetable mixture to the saucepan. Add the garlic and cook over high heat until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost evaporated, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomatoes and their juices, the chicken stock, thyme, and bay leaf. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Cover partially and cook over moderately low heat for 1 hour. Discard the bay leaf. Stir in the heavy cream and cook the sauce just until heated through.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente.</li>
            <li>Drain well, return to the pot, add the sauce, and toss.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta in deep bowls and pass the Parmesan at the table.</li>
